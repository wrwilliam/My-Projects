My project is a web page designing for showing famous place to attract you to visit.
1. Home page include component of Nav.jsx,Shownotshow.jsx and Home.jsx. There are a rotating box to mock the loading, click it will hide.
2. The Nav.jsx is componment of navigation part, and Footer.jsx is footer part of pages.
3. The Form.jsx is for Regist function.When you input text as required, it will show success, otherwise will show inputting as required.
4. Introduction part is text part, which includes Intro.jsx component.
5. Images shows as carousel, can include components of Dot.jsx, Arrow.jsx, and Slider.jsx, as well as sliderImage part.This part is pretty time consuming for me, previously i design search bar, but finially i give up.

6. Notice part pretty simiple. 

Please enjoy my web pages!
